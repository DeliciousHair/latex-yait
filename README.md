Yet Another LaTeX Invoice Template!

This is a minimal and easily customizable LaTeX template for nice and
clean invoices. It should work under PDFLaTeX, but compilation with LuaLaTeX
will use more beautiful fonts.

It was first used as a template for invoices specific to the French status of 
"Auto-entrepreneur", do not hesitate to ask me for a more specific template.

It is under the CC0 license (see LICENSE file) so you can easily adapt it
without even noticing me (though I would appreciate it!).
